# ULTRAKILL "Fuck around and find out" QOL
Adds a variety of utilities for "fuck around and find out"-minded ultrakill users. Things like `teleport`, `movementSpeed`, etc.

## Features
### Cheats
#### Invincibility
Temporary grants full invincibility against all damage sources without having to enable major assists and remember to disable them

### Commands
#### `sv_cheats`
Quickly allows you to enable cheats without having to do the konami code and pressing "Yes"

#### `movementSpeed`
Allows you to modify certain settings in the movement controller, like movement speed, jump power, etc

#### `teleport`
Enables you to teleport yourself to other locations or other enemies to you.

Notes:
- Enemies within an encounter may be buggy to teleport, because some of them appear to have a set region where they may be positioned. They get reset once they leave that area
  - Enemies outside of encounters (or teleporting enemies within their encounter zone) work fine.

## Suggestions
I am looking to improve this mod as far as I can get it, since this is my first actual, "useful" mod for the game. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for more features in the future, please open an issue and tell me about it.
